# CodeBook-CSharp
## About this repo
This repo is created to be useful or readable like a book on programming, here it is C#. However, the contents are created while I am working on or learning the items as per the requirements that I work on. So it is not organized like a book that we usually see in the markets. The purpose is to note down or record the knowledge that I, like all other programmers, happen to come across so it will last relatively longer. 

Will it be really informative or readable like a normal programming book?
I am not so sure. I am just trying something which might have already tried by a million others. Time will tell. Anyway, I will try my best to make it useful and to make the time spent on reading this worthwhile. What can I do to achieve those? The codes will be as readable as possible. In any location suitable, the comments will be written in the purposing of putting some extra light to the subject. Cross-referencing will be made too. 

I hope this can serve as a book-alive to all the readers.
