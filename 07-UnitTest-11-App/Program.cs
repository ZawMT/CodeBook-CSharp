/*
 * This series demonstrates the basic idea of creating unit test cases.
 * First part is 07-UnitTest-11 and 07-UnitTest-12. 
 * 07-UnitTest-11 has the codes to be tested and 07-UnitTest-12 is the test project (Type is MSTest).
 * Different project types can be used to create unit tests and in this series, two types are demonstrated.
 * First one is MSTest (for C#) and the other is GoogleTest (for C++).
 * 
 * In C# (07-UnitTest-11 and 07-UnitTest-12), it is quite descriptive.
 * Test cases can be run by using the 'Test' menu.
 * 
 * For unit test cases created for C++ project, read in 07-UnitTest-14.
